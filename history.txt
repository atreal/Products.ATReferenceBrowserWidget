1.0.1
================

  * converted templates to own i18n domain (hannosch)
  * fixed an allowed_types_method handling bug
    (http://members.plone.org/collector/4131). (alecm)
  * fieldName may not be the same as field.getName() due to the way
    BaseObject.widget() works.  This strangeness is used to make
    Topics/Criteria work, but makes ATRBW unusable in criteria.  Now it works.
    (alecm)
  * Fixed allowed_types handling so that it respects allowed_types_method, and
    fixed the method handling. (alecm)
  * Fixed some base_query brokenness when allow_browse is enabled. (alecm)
  * added i18n infrastructure (hannosch, naro)
  * added support for CSSRegistry

1.0
================
  * added property (search_catalog) to allow querying of alternate catalogs
    (e.g. CMFMember's member_catalog). (alecm)

  * added message in the popup when adding items in multi-select mode. Thanks
    to Limi.
  
  * fixed a bug that occured when setting references on objects located
    in the portal root. Thanks to AlecM.

  * Added base_query property which takes a dictionary or method that returns
    a dictionary containing a catalog query to use as a filter (most useful
    with allow_browse disabled).  All portal_type restrictions use this
    mechanism now which allows for proper use of the field property
    allowed_types_method to make the types restrictions dynamic. (alecm)

0.2.1 
================
  * fixed problem with portal_factory
  
  * fixed problem with startup_directory
  
  * removed automatic install of the demo type.
  
  * added startup_directory patch from optilude (thanks)
  

0.2 - 2004-09-09
================

  * added batched view
  
  * fixed a problem with multiValued
  
  * added view link that opens the object in a new browser
    window so you can check if that's the object 
    you are looking for
    
  * added 'back' link that does a javascript:history.back()
    so you can return to the browser mode after you've
    done a search.
    
  * removed possibility to link to the object itself.
  
  * made the popup window a bit wider and higher

  * modified the 'close window' link. Now sits next to the 'back' link.
  
  * added startup_directory property for the widget to force another
    startup folder in the portal for the popup window.
