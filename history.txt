1.4 - Unreleased
===========================

 * added 'only_for_review_states' property [ajung]

 * added support for (optional) 'additionalReferenceInfo' method  that can
   be used to add additional information for referencable items [ajung]


1.3 - Released May 15, 2006
===========================

 * Removed empty and unused i18n folder.
   [hannosch]

 * Allow empty queries if there are some other constrains provided and
   allow_browse is false. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5181.
   [hannosch]

 * skins/.../referencebrowser_popup.pt:
   - Changed call to ``here.folderlistingFolderContents()`` back to 
     ``here.listFolderContents()`` because this method is not available on
     the ``Plone Site`` object. (so Home did no longer work)
     
   - Refactored the breadcrumb area to not use REQUEST['PARENTS'] anymore
     and added i18n support (RTL and translation for 'Home')
     
     REQUEST['PARENTS'] was evil because if did not work out for sites
     that switch the skin by url and manipulate SiteRoot
     
     (see http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/select-skin-by-url)

  * added 'image_portal_types' and 'image_method' properties. This allows
    you to specify a list of image portal types that are display inside
    the popup widget as images using the 'image_method' (e.g. to show
    images to be referenced as thumbnails)     
    [ajung]

  * added 'show_review_state' property
    [ajung]

  * extended functionality of startup_directory property
    [spamsch]
     
  * added 'allow_ordering' property to order to allow reordering of multiValued 
    ReferenceFields
    [ajung]

  * added 'show_path' property
    [ajung]
 
1.2
================

 * Added a slot for overriding the 'at_url' path to the object, so that the
   widget can be used in scenarios where the path to the relevant object
   isn't so obvious (in Fate for example).
   [alecm]

 * skins/.../referencebrowser_popup.pt:
   Changed call to 'here.listFolderContents()' to 
   'here.folderlistingFolderContents()' in order to avoid requiring
   the 'List folder contents' permission on the folder to be browsed.
   [raphael]

 * Made compatible with CMF 2.0 (CMF <= 1.4) isn't supported anymore
   [hannosch]

1.1
================

 * Added handler for the popup
 * Removed duplicate color definition in popup window

1.0.1
================

  * converted templates to own i18n domain (hannosch)
  * fixed an allowed_types_method handling bug
    (http://members.plone.org/collector/4131). (alecm)
  * fieldName may not be the same as field.getName() due to the way
    BaseObject.widget() works.  This strangeness is used to make
    Topics/Criteria work, but makes ATRBW unusable in criteria.  Now it works.
    (alecm)
  * Fixed allowed_types handling so that it respects allowed_types_method, and
    fixed the method handling. (alecm)
  * Fixed some base_query brokenness when allow_browse is enabled. (alecm)
  * added i18n infrastructure (hannosch, naro)
  * added support for CSSRegistry

1.0
================
  * added property (search_catalog) to allow querying of alternate catalogs
    (e.g. CMFMember's member_catalog). (alecm)

  * added message in the popup when adding items in multi-select mode. Thanks
    to Limi.
  
  * fixed a bug that occured when setting references on objects located
    in the portal root. Thanks to AlecM.

  * Added base_query property which takes a dictionary or method that returns
    a dictionary containing a catalog query to use as a filter (most useful
    with allow_browse disabled).  All portal_type restrictions use this
    mechanism now which allows for proper use of the field property
    allowed_types_method to make the types restrictions dynamic. (alecm)

0.2.1 
================
  * fixed problem with portal_factory
  
  * fixed problem with startup_directory
  
  * removed automatic install of the demo type.
  
  * added startup_directory patch from optilude (thanks)
  

0.2 - 2004-09-09
================

  * added batched view
  
  * fixed a problem with multiValued
  
  * added view link that opens the object in a new browser
    window so you can check if that's the object 
    you are looking for
    
  * added 'back' link that does a javascript:history.back()
    so you can return to the browser mode after you've
    done a search.
    
  * removed possibility to link to the object itself.
  
  * made the popup window a bit wider and higher

  * modified the 'close window' link. Now sits next to the 'back' link.
  
  * added startup_directory property for the widget to force another
    startup folder in the portal for the popup window.
